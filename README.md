# Interlinearis
Learn a Language fast with Audio-Files and Interlinear word-by-word translations into your mother tongue.

**Note:** _This project is currently in its starting phase._


## Concept
The Idea is to use this app along with or in line with the [Birkenbihl-Method of Language-Learning](http://www.vidactic.com/?page_id=868).

Active Listening according to the Birkenbihl-method of language-learning:

## How to use
The idea is that **Text-Bundles** can be imported into Interlinearis, which would contain the following files:
- **config-file** (.json.txt)
- **interlinear-text-file** as html (int.html)
- **source-text** (.source-file)
- **target-text** (.target-file)
- a **database** containing the **interlinear text** (.int-file)
- _optionally_: **audio-recording or song**-file (.mp3/.wav-file))
- _optionally_: **snippet-files**, denoting the start and end of sentences, to allow the currently played sentence in the audio to be highlighted in the text (maybe .snippet-files, maybe .srt-files)

Then the user can open these bundles and study the desired lamguage with the help of an interlinear text and a matching audio. (similar to the [Linguajet-App](https://vimeo.com/202706653))

## Where to obtain Text-Bundles?
Ideally text-bundles could be created with an updated version of the [Interlinear Text-Creator-App](https://github.com/p-freeman/Interlinear-Text-Creator).
<br>(As of now, the software does not yet allow for the creation of Text-Bundles which can be imported into Interlinearis)

## About
Please note, the App:
- has **no ads**
- is **open-source** (and has no copyright)
